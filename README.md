# hello-world
Though I have used Github to search help and look for some geeks' works, I have not officially create any repository on it. This would be my first git-work! Have fun gitting !

I am a graduate student of Data Science and Business Anaytics from UNCC. I lov SQL-related questions and I am an entry-level of R and Python. Hope to have fun on Github. --adding more changes after creation of the repository.
